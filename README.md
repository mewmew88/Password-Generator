# Password Generator

## Creating a password generator using JavaScript

## Overview

This challenge requires me to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on certain prompts that they have selected.  

## Instructions

I have been given a starter code which is to be modified to allow the password generator to run in browser that will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS file both powered by JavaScript. Thus allowing a clean and polished user interface which is responsive and adapts well to multiple screen sizes.

My task is to write a JavaScript code that will validate each input and at least one character type should be selected and the result should be displayed in an alert or written to the page.

* Present a series of prompts for password criteria:
* Length of password
  * At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
* Character types
      - Lowercase
      - Uppercase
      - Numeric
      - Special characters ($@%&*, etc)

The URL of the deployed application:
<https://mewmew88.github.io/Password-Generator/>
should look similar to the screenshots:
